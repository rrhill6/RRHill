          <p>Hi...I'm Rochell! I am an Atlanta based web developer looking for a position with a company or team that builds awesome websites and web based apps. I would be willing to relocate for the right opportunity to work in a challenging and supportive environment.
          </p>
          <p>Building websites started as a hobby for me several years ago with a "little" HTML knowledge and some free time. After many years of teaching high school science, I decided to turn my former hobby into a new career. After a year as a graduate student in an Applied Computer Science program, I continued my education with the help of many books and lots of online resources. I taught myself HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. To add more to my skillset I completed the code immersion course at Tech Talent South here in Atlanta. My current work uses mostly HTML5 with CSS3. Where additional functionality is needed; JavaScript, Ruby (along with Ruby on Rails) and a little Bootstrap is used on projects.</p>
          <p>When I'm not attached to a computer; I enjoy traveling, kayaking and running on trails.</p>
